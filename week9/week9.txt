Task 1: Identify pros and cons of each of three baseline algorithms.
Task 2: Run simulations with each of them using ds-config01–wk9.xml
	Task 2.1: Run them in the normal mode
	Task 2.2: Run them in the interactive mode (using “-i” with ds-server)

BASELINE ALGORITHIMS WITHOUT GLOBAL QUEUE
First-Fit
Pros
Simple algorithim to implement
relatively fast

Cons
Can be wasteful as it only checks IF it is capable, not close the requirements are.

Best-Fit
Pros
Better than FF
Finds the best server to host the job
Cons
Slightly slower than FF.

Worst-Fit
Pros
Gives the job the best chance to be run

Cons
extremely wasteful in both time and space.

DIFFERENCES WITH AND WITHOUT QUEUE
Queues allow jobs to be scheduled while a job is running which mitigates slack time in between two jobs. This does place an emphasis on spacial requirements since if the algoritihm constantly over allocates, it can create large queue times, especially for more intensive jobs thta require those larger servers.
